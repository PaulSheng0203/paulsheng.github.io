<p class="paragraph">
	Nowadays, there are still more than 4 billion people, mostly in developing countries, still don’t have access to the internet.That means those people are unknowing the world that out of them.For example, there are a lot of villages in the mountains and those places don’t have any internet service. Without the Internet, they working on physical things everyday,for example, they would work in the field in the morning and go to friends house in the afternoon.They don’t even know or touch any electronic devices.Actually, it doesn’t affect them to much because they live in their own Way.The other groups of human do have Internet.For example, the human who is typing this essay right now.</P>

	<p class="paragraph">Let’s think about that, if Internet now go to the place that does not have Internet yet, how would the Internet change them? In my imaginary, I think that would make those people having a huge changing in a moment,they would be influenced by the internet.They can get a huge information that more than they have ever know.The specific item that can be improved in their life is, television. In our life which has internet, we can easily get the vision in anywhere with the internet.TV is also an important part in our life.
